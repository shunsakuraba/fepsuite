# FEP-suite: scripts and pipelines for free-energy perturbation calculation works

FEP-suite is a collection of programs for calculating various free energy differences. The pipeline uses GROMACS as a backend. There are currently two pipelines:

* [ABFE](abfe/README.md) (absolute binding free energy) estimator, calculating binding free-energy betweeen receptor and ligand (typically protein and drug).
* [FEP/REST](feprest/README.md) (free energy perturbation / replica exchange solute tempering), a relative free-energy difference calculation pipeline with an enhanced sampling technique.

Under both directory named `abfe` and `feprest` you can see README.md corresponding to each pipeline and how to use. Have fun!

Note the program is currently in "beta" version.
