# Overview

Files in this directory are scripts for supercomputer job submission systems. There are no 'standard' method of the job submission - even if two supercomputer center use the same job system, they often have customization specific to one supercomputer center and they almost never share the same MPI calling commands.
The files here are my solution to this mess - I try to absorb the difference among centers as possible, with a bunch of scripting files.

# What you need to do as a user

If you are not a user of a supercomputer system, the best method you should choose is run with "`JOBSYSTEM=none`", where everything is assumed to finish within your machine. We also assume the toolchains and environments follow current standards - OpenMPI is installed and the node has one or more GPUs.

If you want to use a supercomputer, and if you can find corresponding scripts, specify that to `JOBSYSTEM`. You may probably need to fill in "`GROUP`" and/or "`SUBSYSTEM`" variables to use the script (read the error message if you need).

If you want to use a supercomputer, and if you can't find the script, then you need to proceed to the next section.

# What you need to do as a developer

You need to implement 8 shell functions. Open template.zsh and you can find more detailed information.

`job_prelude()`: Change directory to submitted one and load modules. You also need to set PYTHON3 to be python3

`job_prelude_after_gmx()`: Probably you should do nothing here. If you need post-hook after source GMXRC write something here.

`job_init_queue_stat()`: Probably you should do nothing here.

`job_set_preferred_resource()`: This function typically just sets `CPN` (preferred core per node), `GPN` (GPU per node), `HW_CPN` (REAL core per node, typically =`CPN`), and `HW_GPN` (REAL GPU per node). `GPN` value may be greater than `HW_GPN`; e.g., even if your machine may have only 2 GPUs, you may want to run 4 GPU-using processes for a better *throughput*. You can also change the resource limitation based on requested resources - this is useful when e.g. the supercomputer have a dedicated smaller resource queue (e.g. "shared node").

`job_submit()`: This function submits jobs based on requested resources. You need to consider four things: (1) export necessary environment variables to the job file, (2) add dependency condition to job (or wait until the job finishes), (3) write proper resource requirement to tell job system, and (4) return job ID which will be used in the future job submission as "dependency" info.

`job_mpirun()`: Run MPI with the number of ranks with the first argument (`$1`), number of threads `$OMP_NUM_THREADS`, and with commands specified in `$@` (you need to remove `$1` by `shift` command first). If your MPI caller can control thread pinning, use `$PPN` as processes per node.

`job_singlerun()`: Run program specified in arguments; this is typically just running `$@`, but some supercomputers allow you to only run programs via specific command (`srun -n 1` , `aprun -n 1`, ...)

`job_get_mode()`: This script is called in two ways - one when you submit the job, and the other when you run the batch job. You must return whether it's inside job or not (e.g. by checking environment variables exists)

# Tips for zsh scripting

I use zsh for writing scripts because it allows me to calculate (not so) complex maths inside scripts. But some of you may be experienced user in bash and not in zsh. For them, here are some tips.

Zsh's array index starts from 1. `${ARR[1]}` is the first element. The number of elements is `${#ARR}`.

Zsh's command invocation does not automatically split the command line by " ". For example:
````sh
foo="X Y"
tr $foo <<< "Input XYZ" # tr: missing operand after ‘X Y’
````
will be *an error*. This is because `"X Y"` is *directly* sent to `tr` as the second argument, without splitting by `" "`. Instead you need to use arrays:
````sh
foo=(X Y)
tr $foo <<< "Input XYZ"
````

Expanding variable from variable names can be done with ${(P)x}.

````sh
foo=var
var=1
echo ${(P)foo} # "1"
````

To join an array with a character:
````sh
foo=(X Y Z)
echo ${(j:,:)foo} # "X,Y,Z"
echo ${(j|:|)foo} # "X:Y:Z"
````

To split string into array:
````sh
foo="X,Y,Z"
ARR=(${(s:,:)foo}) # split by ','
echo ${ARR[2]}     # "Y"
````
